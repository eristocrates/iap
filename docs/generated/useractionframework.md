here's a  generated summary that I got during the work on the design of the user actions framework with title as an example concept

 Core Operations (CRUD-like)

1. Create: Add a new instance of the concept (e.g., create a task title).

    Read: View or access the concept (e.g., read the task title, search by title).

    Update: Modify the concept (e.g., change the task title).

    Delete: Remove the concept (e.g., delete the task title or make it anonymous).

2. Extended Operations (Beyond CRUD)

    Interact: Actions that express engagement or preference.

        Like, Dislike, Upvote, Downvote, Favorite, Bookmark, Pin, Highlight.

    Organize: Actions that help users manage or structure the concept.

        Tag, Label, Categorize, Group, Sort, Filter, Archive, Hide.

    Share and Collaborate: Actions that involve others.

        Share, Forward, Mention, Invite, Comment, Notify.

    Transform: Actions that change the form or state of the concept.

        Duplicate, Merge, Split, Copy, Move, Convert, Resize.

    Save and Retrieve: Actions related to persistence and recall.

        Save, Save As, Download, Upload, Backup, Restore.

    Analyze and Learn: Actions that provide insights or feedback.

        Rate, Review, Flag, Report, Analyze, Compare.

    Customize: Actions that allow personalization.

        Edit, Configure, Rearrange, Personalize, Adjust.

    Execute: Actions that trigger workflows or processes.

        Start, Stop, Pause, Resume, Complete, Schedule, Remind.

Core Operations

    Create: Add a new task title.

    Read: View the task title, search for tasks by title.

    Update: Edit or change the task title.

    Delete: Remove the task title or make it anonymous.

Extended Operations

    Interact:

        Like the task title (e.g., to indicate preference).

        Favorite or bookmark the task title for quick access.

        Pin the task title to prioritize it.

    Organize:

        Tag the task title with labels (e.g., "Urgent", "Personal").

        Categorize the task title into a project or folder.

        Archive the task title when it’s no longer active.

    Share and Collaborate:

        Share the task title with others (e.g., via a link or email).

        Mention the task title in comments or discussions.

        Comment on the task title to provide context.

    Transform:

        Duplicate the task title to create a similar task.

        Merge two task titles into one (e.g., if they’re redundant).

        Split a task title into multiple subtasks.

    Save and Retrieve:

        Save the task title as a template for future use.

        Download the task title as part of a report.

        Restore a deleted task title from a backup.

    Analyze and Learn:

        Rate the task title (e.g., for difficulty or importance).

        Flag the task title as problematic or needing review.

        Compare task titles to identify patterns or duplicates.

    Customize:

        Rearrange the order of task titles in a list.

        Personalize the font or color of the task title.

        Adjust the visibility of the task title (e.g., public vs. private).

    Execute:

        Start working on the task (triggered by the title).

        Schedule the task title for a specific date or time.

        Mark the task title as complete.

Generalizing This Framework

For any concept, you can ask:

    What are the basic operations? (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

    How can users interact with or express preferences about the concept? (Like, Favorite, Pin).

    How can users organize or manage the concept? (Tag, Archive, Group).

    How can users share or collaborate on the concept? (Share, Mention, Comment).

    How can users transform or manipulate the concept? (Duplicate, Merge, Split).

    How can users save, retrieve, or persist the concept? (Save, Download, Restore).

    How can users analyze or provide feedback on the concept? (Rate, Flag, Compare).

    How can users customize the concept? (Edit, Rearrange, Personalize).

    How can users execute workflows or processes involving the concept? (Start, Schedule, Complete).

Benefits of This Approach

    Comprehensive: Ensures you don’t miss important user actions.

    Flexible: Can be applied to any concept in any domain.

    User-Centric: Focuses on what users might want to do, not just what the system can do.

    Scalable: Allows you to add new actions as your software evolves.
