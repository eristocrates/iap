***modauxdo***
task management
inspired from to do, i wanted something that could convey things like can do, could do, should do, or even want to do. turns out those are all related by linguistic modality, as modal auxilliary verbs. modauxdo functions as an abbreviation and a french reference to modaux being the plural of modal
 
***chronemia***
time management
inspired from chronemics, the study of how people use time in communication, especially nonverbal communication, and anemia, the problem of not having enough healthy red blood cells (hemoglobin) to carry oxygen to the body's tissues. 
apologies if this sounds weird, but I really like how anemia isn't a lack of enough blood, as some may naively assume. likewise, time management isn't a lack of time. just like how there's a deficiency of oxygen due to a fault in hemoglobin, there's a deficiency of focus due to a fault in attention

***cethreebros***
personal information management (pim)
inspired from xavier's cerebro, and the common discussion of second brains and personal knowledge management (pkm). A third brain. I once read pkm can be consedered to fall under pim, and had a brain blast (pun always intented). i needed to manage information entirely as an entity, at a level above and before the common pkm discussions of turning knowledge into published works
